## Verbs
There are two kinds of verb, る verbs and う verbs. All る verbs will end in る, while all う verbs will end in any う sound, including る.
However, a verb that ends in る, but is preceded by a あ,う or お sound will **usually** be an う verb, while る verbs ending in い or え will
be a るverb in most cases (With certain exceptions).

### Negative Verbs
* To make a る verb it's negative, simply drop the る and add ない
* To make a verb that **ends** in う negative, replace the う with わ and add ない
* For all other verbs, change it's う sound in to it's あ counterpar (く to  か) and add ない

```
食べる　－＞　食べない
```

### Past-Tense Verbs
 * To make a る verb past-tense, drop the  る and add た

### Past Negative
For all verbs, conjugate the verb in to it's negative, then remove the い and add かった, as if it were an い adjective.
