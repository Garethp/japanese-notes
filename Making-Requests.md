## Making Requests

To make a direct request for something, you can use the verb ください, and to make the request as a question, you can use くれる.

それをください  - Please give me that.
それをくる  - Can you give me that ?

You can also request that someone *do* something for you by attaching it to the [て form](Te-Form.md) of that verb

漢字で書いてください
ここにこないでください

In casual speach, you can drop the ください part, since it can usually be inferred from the context
