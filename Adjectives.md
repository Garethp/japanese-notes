## Adjectives

There are two kinds of adjectives, い adjectives and な adjectives. All い adjectives will end with い, although there are
a few rare な adjectives that will also end with い (such as きれい), but most な adjectives that happen to end with い
are usually written entirely in kanji, so you won't see the い. 

な adjectives are very simple, because they essentially act like nouns. All the conjugation rules for な adjectives and 
nouns are the same. The only difference is that in order for a な adjective to modify a noun, you simply place a な
between the adjective and the noun. On the other hand, for い adjectives, you do not need to put anything before the noun.

きれいな人  
静かな人  

おいしい食べる

Unlike な adjectives, where you can attach だ to express state of being, you can never attach だ to an い adjective.
