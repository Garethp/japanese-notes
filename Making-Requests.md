## Making Requests

To make a direct request for something, you can use the verb ください, and to make the request as a question, you can use くれる.

それをください  - Please give me that.
それをくる  - Can you give me that ?

You can also request that someone *do* something for you by attaching it to the [て form](Te-Form.md) of that verb

漢字で書いてください
ここにこないでください

In casual speach, you can drop the ください part, since it can usually be inferred from the context

日本語ではなす

The casual (and slightly feminine) version is ちょうだい, which behaves the same way gramatically

### なさい
なさい is the honorific conjugation of する. It's a gentle, but firm way of telling someone to do something. To use it, it's
necessary to attach it to a verb, as it can't be used stand-alone. Unlike ください, you attach it to the Stem of the verb,
not it's て form. It's casual version simply drops the さい

食べなさい
食べな
ここにすわりなさい

### Imperatives
Though not used often (as it's considered impolite), you can change a verb in it's imperative form as such

 * For る-verbs, replace the る with ろ
 * For the う-verbs, change the last character from an /u/ sound to an /e/ sound.
 * Exceptions
  * する -> しる
  *  くる -> こい
  * くれる -> くれ

To command the negative of a verb, simply add な to the verb. The difference between this and the casual version of なさい is 
that the verb for なさい is first conjugated in to it's stem, while this verb isn't conjugated at all

食べるな
