### は Particle
The は particle indicated the *topic* of the sentance. It's similar to saying "About this thing"

### も Particle
The も article is used to include another topic in to the sentance. A rough translation would be to
mean "also". For exmaple:

ボブ　：　アリスは学生？  
アリス：　うん、トムも学生

However it would not make sense to try and say "I am a student, also Tom is not a student", so in that
case you wouldn't use も, but the following would be more correct.

ボブ　：　アリスは学生？  
アリス：　うん、でもトムは学生じゃない。

However the following would make sense.

ボブ　：　アリスは学生？  
アリス：　ううん、トムも学生じゃない

### を Particle
The を Particle is the Direct Object Particle. It indicates that an action is done directly to the verb before it. For example:

日本語を勉強する

Means to study Japanese. The を article indicates that 日本語 is what the verb is acting direclty on

### に Particle
The に Particle indicates that something is done *towards* an object, such as　ボブは日本に行った, Bob went *to* Japan. However, it's also used outside of direction verbs. For example, you say that something is somewhere because it exists towards that place. Such as 猫は部屋にいる, which would literally translate to "About the cat, it exists towards the room" but actually means "The cat is in the room".

### へ Particle
Unlike the に Particle, the へ Particle only indicates that the noun is the general direction that the verb is acting on, not that it's the final destination. Such as going in that direction, or going towards victory. When used as a particle, it's pronounced as え, not へ.

### で Particle
This is the context particle, such as where an action took place. Such as バスで帰る
