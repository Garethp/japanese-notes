### は Particle
The は particle indicated the *topic* of the sentance. It's similar to saying "About this thing"

### も Particle
The も article is used to include another topic in to the sentance. A rough translation would be to
mean "also". For exmaple:

ボブ　：　アリスは学生？
アリス：　うん、トムも学生

However it would not make sense to try and say "I am a student, also Tom is not a student", so in that
case you wouldn't use も, but the following would be more correct.

ボブ　：　アリスは学生？
アリス：　うん、でもトムは学生じゃない。

However the following would make sense.

ボブ　：　アリスは学生？
アリス：　ううん、トムも学生じゃない
